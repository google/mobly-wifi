class FileClipper:
  """The util class for clipping a given host file to multiple fragments.

  This receives a file which is continually being written new content. Users can
  call `clip_new_content` multiple times. Each call will clip the newly appended
  content after the last call as a fragment, and write it to a new file.

  The key point of this class is that it maintains the stream position for all
  `clip_new_content` calls. When `clip_new_content` is called, it reads the
  given file by moving the read stream position to the file end. Then it keeps
  this position unchanged, and the next `clip_new_content` call will start
  reading the file from that position. In this way, each `clip_new_content` call
  only contains the newly appended content after the last call.

  Typical usage:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Preparation
    file_clipper = FileClipper('/tmp/log')

    ... # Append 3 lines to /tmp/log and clip these 3 lines to /tmp/log_clip_1
    file_clipper.clip_new_content('/tmp/log_clip_1')

    ... # Append 5 lines to /tmp/log and clip these 5 lines to /tmp/log_clip_2
    file_clipper.clip_new_content('/tmp/log_clip_2')

    ... # Append 2 lines to /tmp/log and clip these 2 lines to /tmp/log_clip_3
    file_clipper.clip_new_content('/tmp/log_clip_3')

    # Close this clipper and it can no longer clip new contents
    file_clipper.close()
